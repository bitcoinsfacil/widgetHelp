## What is a Virtual Private Server?

A virtual private server (VPS) is a computer on the cloud sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. It runs its own copy of an operating system (OS), and customers may access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that operating system.

## Which service provider should i choose for my Virtual Private Server? 

We are going to use [https://www.vultr.com/](https://vultr.com/?ref=7664225) for this instructions.

You are free to choose any type of Internet Hosting Service that gives you multiple free IPv6 addresses.
